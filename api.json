      "summary": "Conspiracy theory that aircraft contrails are actually chemical or biological agents deliberately sprayed by governments for nefarious purposes. Scientific consensus identifies these as ordinary contrails - condensation trails formed by water vapor.",
      "full": "The chemtrails conspiracy theory claims that the long-lasting condensation trails (contrails) left by aircraft are actually chemical or biological agents intentionally sprayed for purposes such as population control, weather modification, mind control, or biological warfare. In reality, contrails are well-understood atmospheric phenomena consisting of water vapor from aircraft engine exhaust that condenses and freezes in cold atmospheric conditions. The persistence and spread of contrails depends on atmospheric humidity, temperature, and wind conditions. Scientists, pilots, and meteorologists universally reject chemtrail claims as pseudoscience."
